# SQL Practice & Portfolio (Basics to Advanced)

## Overview

This repository contains my SQL practice work as I prepare for a **Data Analyst role**.
The queries are written while learning SQL **from fundamentals to advanced concepts**, with a focus on correctness, readability, and real-world data analysis patterns.

This is **not a dump of random queries**. Files included here are curated, cleaned, and runnable.

---

## What this repository demonstrates

* Strong understanding of SQL fundamentals
* Ability to write clean, readable queries
* Correct handling of edge cases (NULLs, duplicates, joins)
* Progressive learning from basic queries to advanced analysis
* Analytical thinking, not just syntax usage

---

## Topics covered

Depending on the folder, you will find examples of:

* Basic SELECT statements
* Filtering and sorting (`WHERE`, `ORDER BY`)
* Aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.)
* Grouping (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)
* Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
* Subqueries
* Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
* Window functions
* NULL handling
* Basic data modeling concepts

├── basics/
├── filtering-and-aggregation/
├── joins/
├── subqueries/

└── README.md
```

Each folder contains:

* SQL scripts
* Sample tables and data (where required)
* Comments explaining the intent of the query

---

## How to use this repository

* Queries are written in **standard SQL** (primarily compatible with PostgreSQL / SQL Server concepts)
* Sample tables are created within scripts where necessary
* Files can be executed independently unless stated otherwise

---

## Learning approach

1. Practice concepts privately
2. Refine queries
3. Publish only clean and correct solutions
4. Revisit and improve earlier work as understanding deepens

This repository evolves as my SQL skills improve.

## Disclaimer

This repository is for **learning and demonstration purposes**.
Some datasets are simplified to focus on SQL logic rather than business scale.
